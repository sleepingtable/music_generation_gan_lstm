This research projects aims at generating music by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which models include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. In order to better analyze the results obtained with such a network, another more classic network also using LSTM network is trained on the same dataset.
This allowed to grasp the main issue in this project and similar ones as being the difficulty in creating sequences out of noise by using LSTM layers in a way that is efficient, as is discussed at the end of the paper.
